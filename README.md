# ReactJS + Flux Example Application
This example uses ReactJS and Flux to create a simple Task Keeper application that can be moved to a working web enviroment via a single html, css, and webpack/babel bundled js file.

# Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run build
# open ./index.html in your browser
```

# Watch

Instead of manually building after each change it's possible to automatically recompile the javascript bundle when files change:

```bash
npm run watch
# make javascript changes, then refresh ./index.html
```
